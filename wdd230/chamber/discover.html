                <img src="images/Igreja_dasdores_800.jpg" alt="our lady of sorrows cathedral">
                <p>Porto Alegre was first established as a small village in 1752 under the name Porto de Viam√£o by a group of 60 married couples from Portugal's Azores Islands. However, the settlement was not officially founded until March 26, 1772. A year later, Porto Alegre was made the provincial capital, and over time, especially since the 19th century, immigrants from across the world have arrived in Porto Alegre in search of a better life. The city has endured various wars, including the Farrapos War, but continued to develop. Porto Alegre is the birthplace of many internationally renowned Brazilian writers, politicians, and artists.</p>
